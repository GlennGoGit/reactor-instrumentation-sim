# Reactor Instrumentation Simulation (Demo)

This project simulates instrumentation and control loops inspired by U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion systems.  
The goal is to model sensor readings (e.g., temperature, pressure) and demonstrate how automated feedback systems respond to maintain stability.  

⚠️ NOTE: This project uses **synthetic data** and simplified logic — it is intended only as a demonstration of coding and control system concepts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, matplotlib)  

---

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Instrumentation and sensor data simulation  
- Feedback control loop concepts  
- Data visualization of system behavior over time  

---

## 📂 Files
- `control_simulation.py` → Python script that simulates reactor instrumentation data with feedback control  
- *(Future enhancement)* Jupyter Notebook version for interactive visualization  
- *(Future enhancement)* PNG plots for quick visualization in README

## ▶️ How to Run
Clone this repo and run the simulation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlennGoGit/reactor-instrumentation-sim.git
cd reactor-instrumentation-sim
python control_simulation.py
