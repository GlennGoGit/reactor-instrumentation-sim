# Reactor Instrumentation Simulation (Demo)

Demonstration of sensor instrumentation and control loops inspired by Navy nuclear propulsion systems.  
The simulation models reactor parameters (temperature, pressure) and control responses.  

⚠️ NOTE: All examples are generic and for educational/demo purposes only.
